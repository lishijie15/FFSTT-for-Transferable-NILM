# NeuralNILM_Pytorch

- **Introduction**

  Given that it is difficult to reproduce some NILM algorithms, we create this code repositories implementing some state of the art (or classical) **energy disaggregation algorithms** by the means of prevailing deep learning toolkit **Pytorch** [1] and noted NILM toolkit **nilmtk** [2].
